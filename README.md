# CleverHangman

## Description

This project simulates all the typical features of the classic Hangman game, but with a twist. This rendition includes a debug mode, which analyzes how many words could fit what remains of the secret word (for example: the words "treat", "twist", and "toast" being drawn from the template "t _ _ _ t") and chooses one of the remaining words at random to prolong the game and make it harder for the user to guess the word.
